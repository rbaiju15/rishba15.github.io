Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated by speed. Whether it was my first bike, scooter, or skateboard, if it had wheels, I went fast in it. As I grew older, I also discovered the vast world of motorsport, a collection of various racing and driving championship series from Formula 1 to Nascar to Class B Rally. Now in college as a mechanical engineering major, I have found an environment where I can hone my skills and focus on how to combine my childhood fascinations with real-world skills employers care about. Particularly, I've been working hard at understanding the intersection between MechE and Computer Science, and using these two fields to work on embedded electronics, data analysis platforms, and other similar projects. 

Displaying Projects 
======
Like many engineers, I have certain projects I want to display. To do so, this site will have integrated project portfolios. These portfolios will include detailed summaries of project work, technical research and datasheets, photos and other media, and personal insights into the daily workings of the project.

Such portfolios are essential, as they can provide deep insight into my interests and how I approach and tackle various problems. To learn more about engineering portfolios, check out this [Indeed blog](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-portfolio-engineering). To navigate to my portfolios, click the portfolio navigation button at the top of the screen and select which project you would like to view.

Experiences
=====
For me, being an engineer is all about being practical. My favorite story regarding engineering is an excerpt from *The Scientific Blacksmith* by Mortimer E. Cooley, the founder of the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Michigan. In it, he describes how the first class he taught in MechE had six students. After showing them how to light and heat a forging furnace, he asked the students to retrieve a piece of wrought iron from a bucket of scraps in the back of the classroom. After a few minutes, the students couldn't differentiate wrought iron from the cast iron and steel in the bucket. However, when prompted, all of them could easily explain the chemical differences between the types of iron. Cooley took this as a lesson to always focus on the practical and how engineers could take the heaps of theoretical knowledge they had and apply that to actual engineering projects. This is why I believe engineering experiences are of the utmost importance. Even with all the research and knowledge in the world, without a practical way to apply it, it is useless. That is why I have dedicated an entire section to the engineering experiences I have taken part in and how those experiences have turned me into a better, more insightful engineer.
