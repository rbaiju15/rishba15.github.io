## What it is
This project demonstrates a small, *interactive* engineering tool embedded directly into a portfolio card and page.

## Why it matters
Engineering portfolios should show **how you think**—not just screenshots. This interactive element lets someone explore the concept in seconds.

## Tools / Skills
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- HTML/CSS
- Data visualization (lightweight)
- Engineering intuition + communication
