## What it is
This project was the culmination of all the lessons I learned in CMU's 15-112 Fundamentals of Computer Science course. After extensive work with Python to understand data structures, coding essentials, and efficiency, I was able to put together this project in about a week.

## Why it matters
I truly believe application is the only way to prove your learning, and I think this project represents the culmination of my work over one semester. While it certainly has a long way to go, I think that represents my continued commitment to learning computer science and improving my skills.

## Tools / Skills
- Python
- Data Structures
