## What it is
Using some simple API's and AI, I built a simple web app that helps you see when its cheaper to travel to certain countries. Use the tool to compare your home country's currency to countries you want to travel to to see if its favorable to travel there now.


## See It For Yourself
Below is a link to the website (which is public and hosted on Streamlit) or go check out the Github repository to see the code (you will need your own API key for CurrencyAPI if you want to run it this way)
