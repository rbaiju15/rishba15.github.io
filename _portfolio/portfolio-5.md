## What it is
Using some simple free online tools like Render, Poostgres, and Streamlit I was able to create a fully functional frontend/backend tool for keeping track of all your applications. You no longer need to use messy spreadsheets or unorganized Google Docs!


## See It For Yourself
Below is a link to the website (which is public and hosted on Streamlit). If you want to go check out the Github repository to see the code, I have included that link as well.
