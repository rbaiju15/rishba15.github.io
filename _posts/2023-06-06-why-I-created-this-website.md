Come join me in my first ever blog post. In this post, I want to tell you why I made this site, and what I hope to accomplish with it!

My Purpose
======
As a passionate and adventurous young person, I have always charged into life head on. I have never waited to document any of my endeavors, as I always thought it was a waste of time. In fact, a funny story is when I went to the Biltmore Mansion with my family. My parents spent so long taking pictures of the various rooms, that I fell asleep leaning against a column out of pure boredom. But as I've grown older, I have certainly regretted not having records of some of life's best moments. One of those reasons is actually due to a condition called aphantasia. It is a relatively rare condition that means I cannot see pictures or images in my mind. While it certainly has not been a major setback for me, I often don't remember images or experiences as well as I remember facts or figure. Therefore, I want to use this website as a way to aggregate my experiences and journeys. Of course, since this also serves as a sort of academic page, it will be geared towards engineering and my continued academics, but sprinkled along will be other unrelated parts of my life. I hope you enjoy this website, and use it to learn more about engineering and about me! 

What to Expect
======
Displayed within the website are my homepage, portfolio, blog posts, experiences, and research. You can learn more about each of them below.  

A Homepage of Me
-----
Here, you can find a landing page for the website. Along the left side is a short description as well as links to my various social media pages, like Github, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Along the top you will find a navigation bar to move around the different parts of the site. And finally, in the main body, you will find various pieces of information, new posts, and general updates.

Portfolio
------
Like many engineers, I have certain projects I want to display. To do so, this site will have integrated project portfolios. These portfolios will include detailed summaries of project work, technical research and datasheets, photos and other media, and personal insights into the daily workings of the project.

Such portfolios are very important, as they can provide deep insight into what exactly I am interested in and how I approach and tackle various problems. To learn more about engineering portfolios make sure to check out this [Indeed blog](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-portfolio-engineering). To navigate to my portfolios, simply click the portfolio navigation button at the top of the screen and select which project you would like to view.

Blog Posts
-----
Blog posts are a great way to communicate information, and I intend to use them often. While most of my posts will be centered around engineering, I also want to include other topics. From my varied interests to my travels, my blog posts will be a mix of fun and business that should hopefully keep you captivated. I also want to take this opportunity to improve my writing. Writing has always been my weakest subject, and therefore, I want to improve it through blogging. As you read through my blogs, you should see a progression in my writing (I hope at least!). However, I know it won't be perfect, so please be patient with me and if you have any suggestions, send it over through me via DM.

Displaying Experiences
-----
For me, being an engineer is all about being practical. My favorite story regarding engineering is actually an excerpt from *The Scientific Blacksmith* by Mortimer E. Cooley, the founder of the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Michigan. In it, he describes how the first class he taught in MechE had six students in it. After showing them how to light and heat up a forging furnace, he asked the students to retrieve a piece of wrought iron from a bucket of scraps in the back of the classroom. After a few minutes, the students couldn't differentiate wrought iron from the cast iron and steel in the bucket. However, when prompted, all of them could easily explain the chemical differences between the types of iron. Cooley took this as a lesson to always focus on the practical, and how engineers could take the heaps of theoretical knowledge they had and apply that to actual engineering projects. This is the reason why I believe engineering experiences to be of the utmost importance. Even with all the research and knowledge in the world, without a practical way to apply it, it is of no use. That is why I have dedicated an entire section to the engineering experiences I have taken part in, and how those experiences have turned me into a better more insightful engineer.

Sharing Exciting Research
-----
I have always been someone who is constantly looking for new information. My interests are random and varied, and often lead me down wild paths. For example, my interest in geography led me to be able to name every country and its capital, my interest in the military led me on a path of restructuring my life around discipline and accountability, my interest in politics/economics led me to writing a 4000 word research paper on Rwanda, etc. Since the main focus of this page is engineering and speed, my research regarding these topics can be found under the research tab. However, for my more whimsical interests, check out my blog posts where the endless waterfall of information in my mind that is at the same time useful and useless is collected and recorded!
