Come join me in my first ever blog post. In this post, I want to tell you why I made this site, and what I hope to accomplish with it!

My Purpose
======
As a passionate and adventurous young person, I have always charged into life head-on. I have never waited to document my endeavors; I always thought it was a waste of time. But as I've grown older, I have regretted not having records of some of life's best moments. Therefore, I want to use this website to aggregate my experiences and journeys. Since this also serves as an academic page, it will be geared towards engineering and my continued academics. But other unrelated parts of my life will also be sprinkled along. I hope you enjoy this website and use it to learn more about engineering and about me! 

What to Expect
======
Displayed within the website are my homepage, portfolio, blog posts, experiences, and research. You can learn more about each of them below.  

A Homepage of Me
-----
Here, you can find a landing page for the website. Along the left is a short description and links to my various social media pages, like GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Along the top, you will find a navigation bar to move around the different parts of the site. And finally, in the main body, you will find various pieces of information, new posts, and general updates.

Portfolio
------
As mentioned on my homepage, my portfolios will be opportunities to display cool and interesting projects. Keep checking back to see what I do!!

Blog Posts
-----
Blog posts are a great way to communicate information, and I intend to use them often. While most of my posts will be centered around engineering, I also want to include other topics. From my varied interests to my travels, my blog posts will be a mix of fun and business that should hopefully keep you captivated. I also want to improve my writing. Writing has always been one of my weaker subjects; therefore, I want to improve it through blogging. As you read my blogs, you should see a progression in my writing (I hope!). However, I know it won't be perfect, so please be patient with me, and if you have any suggestions, please send them over!

Displaying Experiences
-----
As I explained on my homepage, experiences are very important to me. While I may not have many right now, I hope to continue participating in more experiences in the future. As I do, I will make sure to document them right here.
