Welcome to my new series on the engineering of F1. Read on to explore more about what I hope to achieve.

What is TEOF1?
======
While Formula One is all about fast cars and skilled drivers, a deeper, less understood world exists below the surface. And no, it's not magical or mysterious; it's the engineering behind F1. In this series of blog posts, I want to explore various engineering-based concepts, like how F1 cars work, how teams implement new techniques, and what makes a car fast. I hope you enjoy this series!!

Red Bull Gives You Wings....Looks Like Max Verstappen has Been Drinking a Lot of It
------
Following the highly controversial 2021 F1 season, where Max Verstappen barely beat Lewis Hamilton in the season finale at Yas Marina, everyone looked towards the new regulations coming to F1. The most significant regulation change since the start of the turbo-hybrid era, which Mercedes dominated, the new rules completely changed the cars, making them bigger and heavier and promising better following. If ever there was a time to proverbially and literally overtake Mercedes, it was the 2022 season. And in the end, Mercedes 'spun out' all on their own, completely failing to take advantage of the new regulations. After the season opener in Bahrain, it looked like Ferrari would be the dominant team, with Red Bull chasing behind. But as the season wore on, it quickly became apparent that Ferrari had a long way to go in terms of strategy, and the Red Bull duo of Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez began collecting 1-2's like they were picking up cases of Red Bulls from the grocery store. In the end, Verstappen easily won the championship well before the season-ender, with Charles Leclerc of Ferrari barely edging out Perez for second in the championship thanks to his earlier wins. But as the 2023 season began, even Ferrari fell behind. Verstappen blazed his way to victory by 12 seconds from the very first race. Next was Perez, who had a 26-second gap to third place Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin (I was pumped for Alonso, easily my favorite driver on the whole grid). The Red Bull duo traded wins back and forth for the next few races before Verstappen blazed ahead, winning six grand prix in a row, starting in Miami and continuing until the latest race in Britain. He is only three races away from tying Sebastian Vettel's record of 9 race wins in a row, which he would accomplish at his home Grand Prix in the Netherlands. No one else this season has even come close to winning a Grand Prix, the closest being two-tenths of a second at the Australian GP, but only because of a late safety car restart. But why has Red Bull's car been so dominant, and how has the team's lead designer, Adrian Newey, done it?

The Most Complicated Floor You Will Ever See
----
The most significant advantage Red Bull has is their floor. The floor of an F1 car is a giant downforce generator. It keeps the car stuck to the ground and allows drivers to take corners more quickly. If you have ever enjoyed riding in an expensive sports car like a Ferrari or Audi, you've probably marveled at how the car stays glued to the ground when taking fast corners. That is downforce at work. An F1 car generates downforce primarily through its nose, floor, and tail/diffuser. When the car moves forward, the nose splits the air before it. The air that flows up along the car's body is at a high pressure. The air that forces itself under the car through the floor is at a low pressure. This pressure difference is what makes downforce. By modifying the floor, teams can change how the downforce is created and how effective it is. The floor of every car also has a forward tilt, or 'rake.' This creates an extremely low-pressure zone towards the front of the car before gradually tapering up and smoothing out the air out the back with the help of the rear diffuser. You might have seen pictures of the Red Bull floor when it was lifted by crane off the track in Monaco and seen the difference in complexity compared to the floor of a team like Williams. And while many think the team has infused some unexplainable magic into their floor, I believe there is a more straightforward explanation.

Porpoising...A Cute Sea Animal But a Hellish Racing Phenomenon
----
If you watched the beginning of the 2022 season, you saw how many teams suffered from a phenomenon known as porpoising. Like the animal, the car's rear end would bounce up and down. An overload of downforce causes this. With the 2022 cars being geared for much higher levels of downforce, the cars were sucked closer to the ground. If a team did not have their suspension perfectly set up, the car would be pulled too close to the ground. The pressure would then become too low, essentially causing the air to stall. This would release the downforce and pop the car back up. But as soon as it did so, the car would get sucked back down, creating an endless loop of bouncing that had drivers like Lewis Hamilton struggling to even walk after driving the cars. It became such a massive issue that the FIA had to step in and raise the cars' ride height to stop such excessive porpoising. But one team that had barely any problems with porpoising was Red Bull. 

The Einstein of F1â€”Adrian Newey
---
It is hard to argue that Adrian Newey is not one of history's greatest F1 car designers. With six drivers and five constructors championships under his belt, with another set of each likely coming at the end of this season, he and Christian Horner have turned Red Bull from a floundering and forgotten team into a powerhouse. But why is this car so special? One of the things teams have had to balance over the past two seasons has been ride height. If you can get a lower ride height, you get more downforce. But too low of a ride height, and you risk porpoising. Somehow, Red Bull has managed to get their ride height lower than other teams without worrying about porpoising. While there is no publicly available information regarding the car design, as such information is kept under lock and key, we have some idea as to why Red Bull might be so dominant. The most significant advantage Red Bull has is a better suspension. They have found the right balance of suspension, which has allowed them to ride lower without giving up performance. This adds stability to the car and allows the drivers to take corners faster and more confidently, which adds up throughout a race. Paired with a world-class engine, it's no wonder Red Bull is ahead. But there are also some other reasons why.

DRS...Domination, Red Bull, Surely
----
One of the critical aspects you may have noticed when watching the Red Bulls this year is just how effective their DRS systems are. Every time the rear wing opens, it's like the car becomes a rocket ship, blasting by the opposing car like it's nothing. To me, it seems like Red Bull has been far ahead of the other teams in creating track-specific rear wings. Since every circuit demands something different from the cars, having a tailor-made wing can be super helpful. Of course, some of the smaller teams don't have the budget to make new wings for each race, but even against the more prominent teams like Mercedes and Ferarri, Red Bull seems dominant. It was apparent at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, where Red Bull came equipped with a bespoke wing fitted with only one beam wing element compared to the other teams, who could only run slightly modified versions of their Bahrain GP wings. This speaks to the organization and dominance of Red Bull and the incredible skill of Adrian Newey in balancing cost and performance more than anything else and demonstrates the power of having a well-organized engineering team in place.

A High Flying and Hotheaded Driver
---
Of course, no discussion of Red Bull would be complete without discussing their darling driver, Max Verstappen. While there have been questions regarding Sergio Perez's place on the team, it is undeniable that Max is currently the best driver in the world. Having a driver like that paired with an incredibly engineered car is simply a recipe for success. Overall, Red Bull has combined ingenious engineering with a solid team. And it surely will lead them to yet another championship this year, and likely, barring any significant changes, their dominance will continue at least until the next set of regulation changes slated for 2026.

Thank You
