Disaster has struck with my electric go-kart! Read on to find out the issue and how I plan on fixing it.

Oh No....ðŸ¤¦
======
Okay, I click-baited you guys a bit. My go-kart didn't actually blow up, but it did break. And I learned an important lesson and am out 35 dollars.

What Happened?
----
When I drive my go-kart, I must get it off my driveway and onto the street. I could go straight off my driveway, but because of the curb, the bottom of the kart scrapes against the sidewalk. So, instead, I turn right and drive along the sidewalk before getting onto the road at one of the pedestrian crossing points that are flush with the road. Yesterday, when I was doing so, I accelerated a bit too early. I was half on the curb and half off, and when I accelerated, I could hear an odd noise. I thought the wheel was spinning, but as I tried to go forward, the kart wouldn't move, and it would create an awful noise. However, at low speeds, the kart moved fine. I immediately got out of the kart and looked around. At first, nothing seemed out of place. But then I noticed it. The teeth of the drive sprocket had completely worn off. That's why, at low speed, it could catch the sprocket, but when I tried to go fast, the chain would slip. But why did this happen? I think it was a combination of two factors. The first was that I pulled the chain too tight. By pulling the chain tight, I put excess force on the sprocket, causing it to wear down over time. The second factor was me accelerating too quickly. Because the forces of the tight chain weakened the sprocket, when I tried to accelerate quickly, the teeth rapidly wore off. What a disaster!  

The Fix
------
Thankfully, there is no significant damage to the kart, as the title might suggest. The chain, driven sprocket, and motor all seem in working condition, so I'm not worried I will have to replace them. I have already ordered a new drive sprocket, but this time, it will be made out of wear-resistant steel for added protection. Further, I plan to loosen the chain when I install the new sprocket. For the first significant problem with the kart, I am thankful it was a fixable one, and in the end, I learned a valuable lessonâ€”a chain too tight is a chain not right.
