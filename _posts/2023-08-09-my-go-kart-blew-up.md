Disaster has struck with my electric go-kart! Read on to find out the issue and how I plan on fixing it.

Oh No....ðŸ¤¦
======
Okay, maybe I clickbaited you guys a bit. My go-kart didn't actually blow up, but it did break. I learned an important lesson and am out 35 dollars.

What Happened?
----
When I drive my go-kart, I have to get it off of my driveway and onto the street. I could drive straight off of my driveway, but because of the curb, the bottom of the kart scrapes against the sidewalk. So instead, I turn right and drive along the sidewalk before getting onto the road at one of the pedestrian crossing points that are flush with the road. Yesterday, when I was doing so, I accelerated a bit too early. I was half on the curb and half off and when I accelerated, I could hear an odd noise. I thought maybe the wheel was spinning, but as I tried to go forward, the kart wouldn't move, and it would create an awful noise. However, at low speeds the kart moved fine. I immediately got out of the kart and looked around. At first, nothing seemed out of place. But then I noticed it. The teeth of the drive sprocket had completely worn off. That's why at low speed it could catch the sprocket, but when I tried to go fast, the chain would slip. But why did this happen? I think it was a combination of two factors. The first was that I pulled the chain too tight. By pulling the chain tight, I put excess force on the sprocket, causing it to wear down over time. The second factor was me accelerating too quickly. Because the sprocket was weakened by the forces of the tight chain, when I tried to accelerate quickly, the teeth quickly wore off. What a disaster!  

The Fix
------
Thankfully, there is no major damage to the kart as the title might suggest. The chain, driven sprocket, and motor all seem to be in working condition, and so I'm not worried I will have to replace them. I have already ordered a new drive sprocket, but this time it will be made out of wear-resistant steel for added protection. Further, when I install the new sprocket, I plan on slightly loosening the chain. For the first major problem with the kart, I am thankful it was a fixable one, and in the end I learned a valuable lessonâ€”a chain too tight is a chain not right.
