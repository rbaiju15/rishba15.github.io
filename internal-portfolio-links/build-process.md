What Is This Page?
====
On this page, you will discover every decision and action I took during the entire build process. For each day of the build, I have included a breakdown of everything I did. These breakdowns were written on the evenings after working, and so provide a raw and unfiltered perspective into the build process. Additionally, for each day I will include a commentary written in the present. This perspective allows me to look back and examine my decisions, and evaluate their effectiveness in the context of the whole project. By combining the live and post-build documentation, I hope you will get a better understanding of how I approach projects, and how that can be used in your engineering projects.

Day 1

<details>
<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
Today marked the first actual build date for the go-kart. With many planning days behind me, it was refreshing to actually begin to make real progress on the project. Unfortunately I do not have the bulk of the necessary parts just yet, as they will trickle in over the next few days. However I feel confident that the go-kart should be in a drivable state by the week’s end. Today was really about getting familiarized with the kart and understanding the scope of the work to be done. One key lesson I learned today was that planning can only take you so far, especially in projects such as this. As the mentor who is helping me out with the project, Marty Nazar, said, “These projects tend to gain a life of their own.” And lo and behold, on day one it did. To begin I removed the kart from its storage space in a shipping container before dragging it into the shop. After setting up a pair of horse benches, I lifted the kart up onto it using a forklift. Then using a wrench and socket, I removed the outer plastic shell. After placing it back in storage, I cut the wire running to a kill switch on the steering wheel. This was a modification done by the previous owner of the go-kart to turn the engine off from the seat rather than having to get up and turn off the engine using the mounted killswitch. I also disconnected the throttle wire that ran along the kart’s frame. After that I unbolted the motor from its mount and set it off to the side for possible future use in another project. Next, I decided to take a look at the chain and sprocket drive assembly, which is attached to the rear left wheel. Being a single wheel drive vehicle, Marty felt strongly that there could be some issues due to the excessive forces acting on the area during operation. And sure enough when I unbolted the wheel using an impact driver, the problems started popping up. Firstly, when spinning the axle, I noticed the brake drum and driven sprocket were bent, and would wobble when spun. To confirm this, I used a dial indicator gauge to measure the lateral movement of the driven sprocket. To use the device, I first attached it via its magnetic base to a secure point. It then articulated the dial such that it touched the gear. Then, I spun the gear to determine the point where the dial had the least amount of lateral displacement. Zeroing the instrument, I marked the position with a Sharpie and then spun the gear. Reading the gauge, I determined it had lateral play of around 1/8 of an inch, large enough to make a noticeable difference in the driveability and safety of the kart. Seeing this, I finally began to understand the meaning of Marty’s earlier quote. After determining the issue, Marty suggested that I purchase a whole new drive assembly. As it was anyways required to purchase a new drive sprocket to fit the electrical motor, we decided it would be best if we also purchased a new driven sprocket, chain, and brake drum. This also gave us a chance to explore rotations per minute, and how we could use the specifications of the motor to determine the speed of the kart. With Marty’s vast knowledge of gasoline engines, he estimated the old gas engine of the kart was running at 3600 loaded RPM’s, and thus taking into account the gear ratio of the kart 6:1, and the diameter of the driven tire, 11 inches, we determined the kart was capable of around 20 mph with the gas system. This was calculated by taking the motor rpm and dividing it by the gear ratio to give the wheel rpm. Then using the circumference of the tire, the distance traveled in a minute was determined. After converting into the appropriate units, the speed came out to 20 mph. We then chose to order a 15 tooth drive sprocket, along with a 60 tooth driven sprocket to reduce the gear ratio to 4:1. Reducing the gear ratio as such will give us better speeds. However, you may ask “Why can’t you just run a 1:1 ratio to achieve max power?” While theoretically possible, the torque required from the motor is inversely proportional to the gear ratio. The only reason we could drop the gear ratio from 6:1 to 4:1 in the first place is that electric motors deliver far more torque in a much more smooth fashion as compared to a similarly sized gasoline motor. Thus we felt a 4:1 ratio was the happy medium between speed and torque. To finalize the new expected speed of the electric kart, we needed to determine the loaded RPM of the electric motor. While we won’t know exactly until the full kart is built, we can assume that as a rule of thumb, the loaded RPM’s will be around 90% of the unloaded RPM rating of the motor. With a rating of 3984 RPM, we estimated the loaded RPM’s to be around 3600, and thus factoring in the new gear ratio, we arrived at a loaded speed of around 30 mph, a 50% increase from the old version. RPM’s are a critical part of any moving vehicle, and thus understanding how power is translated from the motor to the wheel through the lens of rotational speed was very helpful in understanding the concept. After completing the preparation and inspection work, I decided to plan where the components of the kart would sit. Using the dimensions of the parts, I used chalk and measuring tools to precisely mark where the batteries, motor, and electronics would sit. Deciding where the batteries would sit was the most difficult part. While they could all fit in the back with the motor, we felt as though the weight on the back would be too great, and the kart would have a tendency to begin to do wheelies. We eventually settled on placing one battery in the back, one laying flat in front of the seat, and the final two directly below the steering column. We also decided to mount the controller and contactor on the back of the seat for relatively easy access. The final task for the day was to complete some planning for the rest of the project. One of the things I found when test driving the kart with the gas motor on it was that at high speeds the steering was very twitchy, and thus posed a severe drivability issue. Further, with the upcoming speed increases, I knew it would only become more of an issue. After speaking with Marty and doing an examination of the steering assembly, we determined that if we reduced the length of the metal piece that turned the wheel, it would require more steering input to turn the wheel, thus reducing the responsiveness of the kart. In the following image, you can see the metal piece and markings for possible bolt holes.

Day one was really an interesting day. I had certainly done a lot of planning, but whenever you come into these large projects you never know what direction they may take. And that was really the lesson Marty tried to teach me on that day. You can do all the planning you want, but with complex systems like vehicles, there are just simply too many variables to keep a track of. Now that doesn't mean planning should not happen at all. What I learned was that a plan gets you to the start of the race. You still have to run the race and along the way you may face difficulties. But if you avoid planning all together, you are basically running the race blind, making it much more likely problems are going to arise. And looking back that planning really came in handy. On day one we encountered a huge problem with the drive assembly. If that wasn't fixed, I don't think the kart would have driven. But because I had done the planning beforehand, I knew exactly where to buy the necessary parts from, and it didn't end up being a huge problem. I think learning how to translate a broad plan into a day-to-day plan of attack was one super valuable lesson I learned from Marty and Pat, and will certainly be something I carry forward into my academics and career.

Day 2

<details>
<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
With the new issues I found on Day 1, I now had a better idea of the possible timeline for the project. While I was highly optimistic coming into Day 1, I quickly learned that no matter how much planning you do, things can always go wrong, with new issues popping up at any time. With the new drive assembly issues, I now felt at least another week would be required for the project. Today I started the day by removing the entire drive assembly from the kart. I used an impact driver to remove the bolt holding the assembly in, and after disconnecting the brake rod, I slid the assembly out. I then separated the driven sprocket and brake drum for further inspection and measurements. At around 10 AM, I received the UPS delivery of some parts I had ordered the previous day. This included the 15 tooth drive sprocket and new #35 chain, and master links. I also received the shipment of 4 12V 35Ah batteries that would power the kart. After inspecting and cataloging the parts, I moved onto battery placement. Using the chalk markings I moved the three forward mounted batteries into position. The rear mounted battery would have to wait until a steel mount was created. As soon as I did, I noticed a problem. When measuring, I failed to account that the battery in front of the steering wheel would hit the support bar. This meant that placing the two batteries longways would not fit anymore. Luckily, by rotating the rear battery, both fit, and I was still able to comfortably place my feet on the pedals. I knew from this point on I would have to be very careful with my measurements, as such mistakes could lead to significant setbacks. At the shop I was completing the project at, there were two people. Marty Nazar is the owner and a long time family friend, but the second person is a man named Pat, with an equal amount of experience in the industry as Marty. His expertise was in electronics, and thus he suggested I mount the batteries on top of thin rubber mats that would both prevent the batteries from slipping, and reduce contact with metal. He also suggested I separate the two forward batteries with a thicker piece of rubber to reduce electrical fault risk. I then spent some time measuring, cutting, and trimming the rubber to be used. I then used spray adhesive to glue the rubber to the frame before test fitting the batteries to ensure a clean fit. Next, I decided to dig through the shop’s electrical box to find the correct wire and connectors for the circuit. Taking into account the amperage of the system, I determined 4 gauge wire would be sufficient, which Pat agreed with. Finally, to finish off the day, I spent time researching and purchasing the replacement brake drum, brake band, and driven sprocket. Thus concluded Day 2. I certainly spent a little less time on the kart today, but I felt as though I made good progress. However, the path forward isn’t all clear. While I have figured out all the mechanical/physical fabrication work that is yet to be done, I still have to determine the wiring setup. Being the most critical part of the setup, I want to take my time on Day 3 to sift through the various part manuals and technical sheets to ensure I fully understand the required wiring setup. Once that is done, it should be relatively smooth sailing for the rest of the project.

Day Two's big lesson was really about being careful and methodical. When I drew out the chalk lines for where the batteries would sit, I failed to take into account the vertical space the battery would take up. Luckily by rotating the battery it fit, but had it not, it would have forced me to really pivot. While I noticed this error right away, I could easily have made a mistake that wouldn't be noticed until much later on that would have forced me to spend a ton of additional time. And it wasn't like I wasn't being super careful. I had taken the dimensions multiple times, checking and making sure the marking were right. But I was so laser focused on the length and width measurements, I completely failed to account for the height. I learned that sometimes you have to take a step back. By slowing down, you give yourself an opportunity to assess the situation and determine what exactly needs to happen. Again, another big lesson for my academics, career, and general life.

Day 3
-
<details>
<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
Today was by far the busiest day of the project, and I certainly am happy with the progress made. To begin the day, I received a package with the rest of the electrical parts for the kart. This included the controller, fuse, diode, resistor, motor, contactor, and throttle. After photographing all the parts, I decided to look through the associated manuals and technical sheets for each of the components. After doing so, I decided to take plenty of time to understand the correct wiring for the circuit. Sitting down with Pat, we looked through the controller’s manual, which included a wiring guide in it. We looked at each part, determining the necessary wires, the connections between each part, and any additional parts necessary. After fully understanding the diagram, we determined we would need a fuse holder for the main fuse, an on-off switch to turn the circuit on, and a smaller secondary fuse to protect against overload during the startup of the motor. This additional fuse would be placed in line with the on-off switch. Looking through the electrical box, I quickly found a switch and fuse, but the fuse holders in the shop could not fit the main fuse that I had. Therefore I ordered a new fuse holder online. After finishing this, I began to create some of the wires for the circuit. Since most of the parts hadn’t been mounted yet, I couldn't create all the wire, but I wanted to begin making them so I could become comfortable with the wiring station. To start a wire, I took the coil of 4 gauge wire and stripped the casing off of the first few inches, exposing the copper wiring. I then clamped on a ring connector head using a crimping tool. I then slid over some heat shrink and used a torch to wrap it around the end of the wire. Then measuring the required wire length, I cut the wire and repeated the process on the other side. While I could only make two wires today, I now felt comfortable with the process. Following this, I decided to mount the controller to its place on the back of the seat. Removing the seat cover, I immediately noticed that the mounting holes on the controller were too wide for the existing metal plate. To fix this, I found a sheet of aluminum and used a handheld cutting tool to cut a piece that could fit to the seat. I then drilled holes through the plate and the existing plate and used bolts to connect the two. Then I drilled holes through the aluminum plate to mount the controller using bolts. Finally, to finish the day, I decided to figure out an appropriate way to mount the batteries in place. My initial idea was to use 90 degree angle steel to box in the batteries at their corners. By placing the bar vertically from the bottom of the kart to the top of the batteries, there would be nowhere to move. However I noticed that since the pieces would be welded in place, I wouldn’t be able to move the batteries for any reason, since it would hit the steering column. I then thought I would use the angles at the bottom of the batteries to create a box, and then lash the batteries using a bungee cord. However, I thought this would be overly complicated, and risked the batteries popping up if I hit a bump too hard. Finally I settled on placing the angle iron on the top four sides of the batteries. I would then weld a threaded rod to the angle iron and run it through a hole in the floor, before bolting it on the underside. This would provide enough clamping force to ensure the batteries couldn’t move in any direction, while keeping the system fairly simple. While I decided that I would do the actual welding tomorrow, under close supervision, I measured and cut all the necessary pieces. I used a bandsaw with a metal cutting blade to cut out the angles and threaded rod, before finding the appropriate nuts and washers, and marking the points that would need to be welded. I also used a handheld sanding tool to remove the galvanized finish from the steel, as that would create toxic fumes when welded.

Day 3 was a two-for-one special of lessons. The first big lesson was about on-the-fly planning. I had looked over the wiring diagram when I initially ordered the parts, and while I technically knew what the diagram said, it was difficult to know exactly what you needed until the parts were in front of you. By having those parts to look at, Pat and I were able to figure out the diagram much easier. Again, planning can take you only so far, you still have to create a daily plan of attack. The second lesson was about having another pair of eyes on you project. My initial idea for securing the batteries was to completely box in the batteries. And had I been working alone, only after I had to remove the batteries for whatever reason would I notice I couldn't get them out. At that point it would be a huge hassle to get them out. But because Pat was with me, he noticed the problem with my idea and pointed it out. Again it all comes back to the idea of taking a step back. Sometimes you get too immersed in your own project, and so it's always helpful to have an outside pair of eyes making sure you aren't making any sort of catastrophic error.

Day 4

<details>
<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
Today consisted mainly of welding. Firstly, I learned all about welding from Marty, who is MIG welding certified, and has been welding for decades. He first showed me how the machine worked, explaining how the machine pushed a roll of steel wire through the gun and out the end. He then explained how a mixture of 25% CO2 and 75% Argon created a bubble of gas around the welding surface before an electrical current superheated the area to weld the steel and keep contaminants out. After donning the appropriate protective equipment, gloves and a self-darkening helmet, I observed as he demonstrated the proper welding technique. I then practiced creating welds on scrap metal, and after a few attempts I was able to lay down a halfway decent line. However, Marty told me that welding was something that required hundreds of hours to master, and that while I was free to continue practicing, it would be best if he did the actual welds for the kart. Seeing that the kart would go at speeds of over 30 mph, I also felt that a poorly created weld from a beginner like me could risk serious damage to the kart or even serious injury to the rider. However, I did observe all the welds that Marty created to better understand the correct technique. After welding the battery mounts, I attached the nuts and ensured the batteries would not move at all. Being satisfied with that, I decided to figure out how to mount the final rear mounted battery. With the existing steel tubing, there was a space that had enough room for the battery to slide right into. All it needed was a bottom to hold the battery up. I decided to take a flat metal bar, and bend it into a C shape using a metal bender, before welding them into place to create a basket for the battery. To ensure the battery could not move side to side, I decided to use the same clamping system I used for the other batteries. However, since I couldn’t drill through and attach the threaded rod from the underside, Marty welded the bottom of the rod to the existing pieces of flat bar. But to ensure I could still remove the battery, we welded a metal tube to the angle iron, before running the threaded rod through it and securing it from the top. Before this though, I again cut out strips of rubber matting to place under the battery. With most of the day gone, I decided to come up with an idea to mount the motor in place. At first I thought I could use two pieces of angle iron on the sides, before running bent metal straps over the top of the motor to hold it in place. But then, Marty reminded me that the motor would have the tendency to want to twist, due to the high amount of torque. So any mount we made would have to properly brace the rotational force of the motor. Taking this into account, I decided to use a steel plate that would slide over the top of the motor, before being secured into place. This is a bit confusing, so I have included the below diagrams for easier understanding. After this, it was time to head home for the day. I felt very good about the progress for the day, and am confident that the project should finish in no time at all. Learning about welding was extremely rewarding, as it continues to be a critical and highly valued skill even to this day.

Learning about welding was very informative and useful. To a lot of people it seems like a sort of ancient skill, and it certainly is when it comes to mass manufacturing. But in bespoke projects like working with vehicles, it is still a highly valued skill. On top of that, the lesson I learned from today was the importance of having an expert to help you out. Not only do you learn the most from someone with decades of experience, they also bring an element of safety to any engineering project. Had I been on my own, the welds would have been shoddy, and prone to breaking. That could have been terrible. I mean a lead acid battery flying off a vehicle going 30mph is not going to be a pretty sight.

Day 5

<details>
<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
Today marked the start of week two of the go kart build process. To begin the day, I reviewed all the tasks that remained on the docket for the week. I noted that the engine mount needed to be fabricated and mounted, the sprocket and brake assembly needed to be reassembled with new parts and remounted, and that final wiring needed to be completed. Wiring can only be done once all parts are mounted so I set that aside for now and focused on reassembling the drive assembly. Before that though I opened and documented all the new parts that I received in the mail. I documented the new driven sprocket, brake drum, brake shoe, and fuse holder. Moving to the drive assembly, I removed the old driven sprocket. I easily removed three of the nuts using an impact driver, however the final bolt was firmly rusted on, and so we had to use a chisel and hammer to break it off. After removing the old sprocket, I fitted the new 60 tooth sprocket and tightened the nuts down. I then slid on the new brake drum and then tightened another set of nuts on. I knew this fitting would not be final because I would need to add additional washers in order to line the brake drum up with the brake shoe. I then slid on the hub to the axle, and guesstimated how many washers I would need. As a side note, Pat recommended I move the washers on top of the existing nut, instead of being in between the sprocket and the hub. He said this would make the assembly stronger, and said the likely cause of the drive assembly being bent was the poor placement of the washers. I fitted 3 washers and luckily it was a perfect match. I locked everything down, though we will add self-locking nuts in the future, and slid the hub on. Once finished with this, I decided to move on to creating the motor mount. The first thing was to take accurate measurements of the motor’s top, so that the correct sized hole could be made in a piece of steel. To do so, Marty showed me how to use and read manual Verniers, and after understanding it, I took the measurements. Then using a ruler and compass, I marked the points for bolt holes and for the pilot hole on a piece of steel plating before drilling the holes using a drill press. Marty then used a plasma cutter to take out most of the material, before showing me how to mount the piece on an industrial lathe. After using the lathe to finish the hole, we sanded the rough edges and laid the plate on the motor, and bolted it down. Following that, we had to create a steel plate perpendicular to the top plate that would attach to the existing motor mounting plate. I quickly measured and cut the plate , before clamping it together with the existing plate. Marty then allowed me to tack weld the pieces together, and thanks to the practice I put in with scrap metal, I was able to lay down a decent quality bead. After that Marty just cleaned up the weld to ensure maximum safety, and we test fitted the mount. Satisfied with the fabrication, we reattached the motor. As it was nearing the end of the day, we decided to come up with a plan of attack for the next day. Using extra steel, we plan on creating gussets to hold the two plates together before fully welding them together. Then we will drill a hole on the mounting plate and attach the motor. From there we can slide on the drive sprocket, and attach it to the drive assembly via #35 chain. Depending on how long that takes, we then plan on reattaching the brakes, mounting the throttle, and start to fabricate all the necessary wires.

Day 5 wasn't really filled with any huge lessons but still a very interesting day in the end. Learning how to use huge machines like the lathe and drill press was really cool. I had worked with all these machines before during the course of robotics or high school engineering class, but with much smaller machines. Seeing the raw power of these machines was truly something else. And it certainly is frightening in a sense. If you aren't careful these machines can take out an eye or break bones very quickly. But what Marty made sure to stress on me was that at the end of the day these are tools. They do exactly what you tell them to do, nothing more and nothing less. If something goes wrong it's because you weren't prepared. So as long as you understand the machine, are comfortable with it, and take the appropriate safety precautions, it will only allow you to achieve more. Tools are meant to increase a human's ability, and if they are treated in such a manner, they are always safe.

Day 6

<details>
<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
Wow, what a day! Today we did so many tasks it’s hard to keep track of them all. To begin, I found appropriate steel pieces and welded the gussets onto the motor mount. After that, Marty “layed the coal in” meaning he completed the final weld, as that weld required the utmost precision and care. After the piece cooled, I marked the positions of the mounting screws and drilled the appropriate holes. I then applied primer and paint to make the piece match the rest of the kart, and let it dry out. I then had to find a place to mount the contactor and fuse holders. Seeing plenty of space between the motor mount and rear battery, I decided to cut a piece of steel plate. Once cut, Marty welded the piece on. I then removed the battery and controller and applied primer and paint to the rear spoiler section. After it had dried, I reattached the controller and battery, and then drilled holes to mount the contactor and fuse holder. Following this, I decided to clean up the kart. I removed the old engine kill switch, ground off rust and raised surfaces, and used pressurized air to blow all the dust and metal chips off the kart. Then me and Marty sat down to figure out how to mount the throttle. The original kart had a mounted pedal that used to be connected to a cable that was attached to the motor. The new pot box throttle requires manual actuation of the lever, and thus had to be connected to the pedal in some way. I quickly noted that it could not be mounted behind the pedal and attached via a cable. This would have been the easiest solution but due to the small size of the kart, my foot would have hit the string. I then experimented with placing the throttle in front of the pedal. Initially I thought I could attach a rod in between the pedal and lever and thus push the lever into actuating. However Marty suggested I should reverse the actuation somehow and pull the lever instead. Looking closely, I realized that the top of the pedal moved forward when pushed, but the bottom moved backwards. All I had to do was create a piece of metal to attach a string at the bottom and then connect the other end to the lever. That way the throttle could be mounted in the front of the kart, but could still be actuated via a pulling motion. I quickly cut a piece of steel and drilled the appropriate holes in it before Marty welded it onto the pedal. I then marked positions for the throttle screw mounts and drilled the holes. I then fastened the throttle down. We decided to attach the cable later once all the appropriate wiring was done and we were sure the throttle assembly worked. From here I moved onto completing the final wiring for the kart. Working with Pat, I quickly fabricated the remaining jumper cables for the inter battery connections. I then ran the appropriate connections into and out of both the controller and contactor, fabricating each wire as I went along. I also attached the appropriate fuses and resistors as specified by the wiring diagram. I also wired the throttle and on/off switch using smaller gauge jumper wires, before mounting the motor in place. The main point of difficulty regarding the final wiring was the polarity of the motor poles. Because the motor wasn’t marked, we had to test each pole to ensure the motor spun the right way and switch the wires if the motor spun the wrong way. Since we didn’t want to cut and make wires until we knew for sure, I found some old jumper test wires laying around in the shop and we rigged up the motor for the test. Since the system had 48V with a large amount of current, we were very careful during the entire wiring process. We always ensured the circuit was never complete until all wires were in place, and were careful when using metal tools around battery contacts. Once all the wires were attached and everything was tightened down, we attached the ground side of the battery pack and turned on the on/off switch. We then held our breath as we actuated the throttle for the first time. To our disappointment, the circuit did not work, but at least nothing caught on fire or exploded. We decided to recheck all the connections, and while we were doing so, I noticed the two voltage input wires of the throttle were in the wrong port on the controller. After disconnecting the ground, I moved the connections into the right slot and after completing the circuit, the motor actually turned. It was extremely rewarding after 6 days of difficult work to see the circuit actually work. From the beginning, I knew the most difficult aspect of the whole project would be attaching the batteries and motor safely and correctly and safely wiring up the circuit. To complete both tasks with relative ease and with only one minor hiccup really spoke to the immense preparation and planning I did before starting the project and to the value of having knowledgeable mentors. My planning consisted of both online research and in-person evaluations. The online research ensured that all the parts I purchased were of the correct specifications, and the in-person planning ensured we knew exactly what we were doing at each stage of the project. And I couldn’t have done all this without the help of two very knowledgeable mentors, Marty and Pat. With almost 50 years of experience each, both knew the ins and out of this line of work. And they didn’t just feed me answers and do all the work for me. Instead they gently prompted me to find the best solutions by myself, and made sure to answer all of my questions so that I knew everything I needed to and more. Further, they made sure I conducted all tasks safely. Working around lathes, belt sanders, chop saws, electricity, hand tools, etc. can lead to serious injury, but only if used unsafely. As long as you are comfortable with the machine and know how to use it correctly, it only augments what you can achieve. Marty and Pat made sure I understood each tool used, and always allowed me to at least try using them, even if the final work had to be done by them for safety reasons. Going into tomorrow, I am extremely confident that I will be able to drive the kart. All that is remaining is to clean up the wiring, reattach the brakes, add the throttle cable, and reattach the rear left wheel.

Day six was all about the throttle, and the experience emphasized the importance of Occam's Razor. The principle states that solutions should be constructed form the smallest possible set of elements. When I was looking at ways to attach the throttle, I immediately jumped to the most complicated solutions. Marty though, with his decades of experience, gently prodded me in the direction of a more simple answer. Seeing how he had immediately found the simplest solution in his mind after just a few minutes really demonstrated the importance of experience and mindset. If you approach problems with the mindset of finding a simple solution, you often will find one. Of course that mindset comes with experience, and I'm not going to beat myself for not finding that answer first, but learning that lesson now sets me up to apply Occam's Razor down the road.

Day 7

<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
And she’s done!!! Finally, we got the kart up and running and barring some cosmetic upgrades, she is fully done. To start off the day, me and Marty finished the throttle setup. We first fabricated a holding piece to attach to the bottom of the foot pedal before looping a piece of wire between the pedal and the throttle lever. The lever had multiple holes so that the length of the wire could be adjusted in order to ensure full range of motion. After experimenting a bit, we found the right hole and used a screw to hold the cable in place. On the old throttle, there was a spring to hold the pedal back, and it attached to a piece of metal that stuck up. However, with the batteries now in the way, my foot could no longer fit with that piece of metal, so we quickly cut it off and drilled two holes in the floor of the frame to reattach the spring into. After figuring out the throttle, me and Pat finished up all the wiring. Now knowing the polarity of the motor, we quickly fabricated the final two wires and used zip ties to hold all the wires nice and neatly. After that was done, we felt a lot better about the looks of the kart. We also drilled a hole in the plastic shell of the kart so that wires could run from the front of the kart to the controller. Next, it was time to attach the chain. But before that we needed to find a “key” for the motor. Since the motor produces such high torque, the manufacturer cuts a square groove into the driveshaft of the motor and the inside of the drive sprocket. The key is just a small bar of metal that fits in between these two grooves before being locked down with lock nuts. This way the drive shaft doesn't shear the chain off when power is applied. After finding and inserting the key, we test fitted the #35 chain, and cut the chain one link short. We then added a master link so that the chain could be removed in the future. Marty also explained how to use the lock for the master link. He told me to always face the closed end of the lock in the direction the chain moves so that it won't get caught on anything and go flying off. After locking that chain and ensuring everything was in place, I tightened the bolts of the motor mount, locking the motor in place securely. All that was left was to reattach the brakes. However disaster struck as we went to do so. The old brake shoe had been used so heavily that friction had worn away the inner wall over time. This meant the shoe could be pulled relatively tight without scraping the brake drum. However since we had a new brake shoe, it had the full thickness of the inner wall intact. This meant it could not be pulled as tight, and therefore the brake rod wasn’t long enough. However, while the issue was annoying, it was relatively easy to fix. I quickly measured the distance required and cut a small piece of metal. I then drilled two holes into it, before attaching one hole to the brake rod and the other to the mounting point, effectively lengthening the rod itself. Before I took the kart for a test run though, I did want to fix the steering issue that I described back on Day 1. I had already marked holes long before, and simply drilled them and moved the steering arms into the holes. However, I noticed as a result, the front tires had extra “toe” to them, meaning they didn't point straight. However I saw the manufacturer of the kart had kept that in mind. The movement arms could be screwed in or out in order to adjust the toe, and so one at a time, I adjusted the toe until I was satisfied they were straight. And so finally, after 7 days of building, we lifted the kart off the horse benches and set it down for a test run. Driving the kart out onto the road and pressing the throttle down was the most exhilarating experience of my life, and knowing that I had built that kart with my own hands only furthered that joy. Pulling the kart back into the shop, I did notice the brakes didn’t fully work. While it was expected that such a cheap friction brake wouldn’t have the stopping force to bring the kart to a full stop instantly, there should have been some amount of stopping power. Examining the brake housing, I noticed the shoe wasn’t fully enclosing the drum when actuated. To fix this, I simply drilled a new hole into the brake rod, slightly tightening the connection. This worked like a charm, and the brakes, while not great, at least worked. Satisfied there were no more issues, I fitted the plastic shell back on, added some decorative stickers, and went back to driving. Unfortunately I didn’t get too much runtime because of intermittent rain showers, but from what time I got, I can say with full conviction that the kart was everything I hoped for and more. After about 10-15 minutes of runtime, the battery voltage had only dropped .5 V, and so my earlier estimates of around 25 minutes of runtime may be incorrect. However, only until I can drive the kart to full discharge will we know. All in all, I am extremely happy with this project. For many years, I would have many great project ideas, but I would never finish them because I never had the motivation or drive to do so. This kart was the first major project in some time that I took fully to completion and I am glad that I did. I want to give a big thank you to both Marty and Pat at Nazar Diesel. Without them, none of this would have been possible, and for that I am extremely grateful.

Wow, this was truly one of the best days of my life. As I briefly described in the documentation, I have had many ideas over the years. Whether it has been engineering projects, business ideas, or just plain fascinations, my mind is constantly working up these ideas. But there is a part of me that fears these ideas. It is a combination of laziness and fear of failure. The main driver is laziness and procrastination, but underneath it all, it is really a fear of failure. I constantly think to myself, 'What if it doesn't work? What if it is all just a waste of time?' And these doubts have held me back from actually executing on many of the ideas I have had. But this was my first major project where I just pushed aside the doubts and moved ahead. I was genuinely scared the entire time that the kart would never work. But being able to ride the thing out of the garage wiped all those doubts from my mind. It instilled a new confidence in me. I knew that from now on, if I just put my all into a project, it would be worth it. For years, I have held myself back, but no longer will I let fear stop me from making progress.

Day 8

<summary>Live Documentation</summary>
While I said I was done with the build yesterday, I forgot to mention the most important and fun part of building a vehicle–test day–yesterday's rain had completely dried up and so it was finally time to drive the kart at full speed all day. While this might sound like just fun and games, test day serves an extremely important purpose. With any project, it’s impossible to tell what may go wrong, and so the only way to know is to go out and use it. And use it I did. I drove around on the grass, did donuts on the gravel, drove drag races on the road, and sent the kart through tight corners and steep uphills. I was really pushing the kart to see what would break, and sure enough, the first thing to fail was the brakes. While driving at relatively low speeds, I heard a clunking noise in the drive assembly, and looking over, I saw the nuts that held the drive assembly down had come loose. Knowing that many times we test fitted assemblies without fully tightening the nuts, I simply assumed I had just forgotten to tighten the nuts. I quickly pulled the kart into the shop and jacked it up, and after some wrestling with the assembly, I removed the wheel and tightened the nuts with an electric socket. After reattaching the wheel and reinflating it, I was excited to get back on the road thinking all the problems were behind me. But after only a few minutes of riding, I quickly realized the nuts had again come undone, and now I knew it was the vibrations of the kart that had loosened the nuts, not my forgetfulness. Luckily there was an easy solution to loosening nuts–nylon self-locking nuts. Quickly finding the right nuts, I quickly installed them, annoyed that I had to remove the wheel again. This time I was sure the kart was done, but as I took the kart up a hill, I suddenly heard metal scraping and saw a bolt flying off the kart. Pulling to the side of the road, I examined the drive assembly and noticed the brake shoe had sheared itself off of the brake drum. I was able to temporarily move the shoe back in place, but I wasn’t sure exactly what had happened, and had no idea where the flying bolt had come from, so I carefully brought the kart back for an examination. Luckily, once jacked up, I noticed the bolt was one of the bolts that held down the plastic shell, and so had nothing to do with the kart’s failure. Knowing I would probably need to remove the shell for repairs, I took it off completely. To fix the brake issue, I quickly realized that a simple welded piece of metal would block the shoe from moving laterally while still allowing it to clamp down on the brake drum. I quickly cut an appropriate piece and welded it on. Additionally, I wanted to examine the steering assembly while the shell was off. When driving, I hadn’t really noticed any issues, since at high speeds the kart did not require much steering input to turn. However, at low speeds, I noticed I could not turn the wheel all the way to the right. Speaking with Marty, we initially thought that some of the bolts in the steering assembly were getting stuck, and so we took them all out and applied Never-Seize, a bolt lubricant, to all of them. After reattaching them, the steering was still tight, and so we thought that there may have been rust built up in the steering column. To get rid of it, we drilled a small hole at the bottom of the column before spraying PB Blaster, a penetrating oil spray, into the column, which would get rid of loose rust build up in the column. We also used a hammer to unbend a few pieces in the steering assembly, and after some time, lot’s of PB Blaster, and many swings of the hammer, the steering finally felt right again. Satisfied with the upgrades to the kart, I reattached the plastic shell, using self locking nuts this time, and took it out for a final test ride. The feeling I felt riding that kart is one I will never forget. I am so glad I decided to build this kart, and with the final test ride Version 1.0 of the go-kart was officially complete. Of course, there are still many upgrades I plan on completing. Firstly, I would like to upgrade the aesthetics of the kart. While I did apply some of my own decals, most of the art on the shell was from the old owner of the kart. In the future I plan on designing my own decals and applying them to the kart. Another thing I plan on making is a custom 3D printed F1 style steering wheel with an integrated electronics suite. This wheel will not only upgrade the looks and steering capabilities of the kart, but will also have a ton of super cool electronics. I plan on having a key switch, a boost button, a LED speedometer and RPM gauge, a battery charge display, and other electronics, all powered via an Arduino control board. Next, I would like to explore the possibility of integrating a hydraulic brake system. The current brakes are purely friction based, and don’t have the stopping power required of the speeds the kart can go to. By integrating hydraulic brake calipers, I can not only improve the braking of the kart, but also learn all about hydraulics, which is a hugely important component of mechanical engineering. The final upgrade I would like to  add would be a gear shifting mechanism. Earlier, when I learned about gear ratios, I learned that a lower gear ratio would allow me to go faster, but would require more torque to run. The current gear ratio for the kart is 4:1, and as long as I don’t jam my foot to the floor from standing still, the motor has enough torque to get the kart going. However, if I can integrate a gear shifting mechanism, I can start the kart with a higher gear ratio like 5:1 or 4:1, and gradually lower it to 3:1 and 2:1 to enable higher top speeds. Since the kart will be going faster, it will have enough power to drive that lower ratio. My current idea is to use something similar to a bicycle’s gear shifting cassette, which allows gear shifting while riding. However, I will have to complete more research to understand if such a system can be integrated into the current kart design. These upgrades will allow me to continue making the kart better while furthering my learning experience. I am super excited to get started on them, and will be back to update you as soon as I do. Again, I want to thank Marty and Pat at Nazar Diesel for all the help making my dream come true, and I hope you have learned a lot by following me on this journey in building this kart.

The final lesson of the build process was about testing. Today engineers work with increasingly complicated systems. In such systems, it is impossible to know every interaction between every variable, or how changing one variable might affect the rest. Even with advanced tools like digital measurements,3-D modeling, and AI, it's just impossible. Malcolm Gladwell wrote a very interesting piece on this topic, where he explored how large engineering failures like the Challenger Shuttle Explosion or the Three Mile Island Disaster came about because it was impossible to connect how many small failure points would come together to create a tragic accident. The lesson though is not that our projects are doomed to fail because they are complicated, rather it is that extensive testing is required to find failure points and address them before they become an issue. And that is exactly what I went out and did. By running the kart extensively, I managed to find a critical failure point in the brakes, and an issue in the steering. Had I not tested and simply went home, I would have had a much harder time fixing such problems.
