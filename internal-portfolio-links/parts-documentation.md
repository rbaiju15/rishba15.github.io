Here you will discover all the research and planning that went into finding the parts for my go-kart. Every component, from the bolts to the motor will be broken down. You will learn not only how the parts fit together, but how each part works along with pictures and facts I learned about them along the way.

<summary>DC Motor</summary>

<summary>What is a DC Motor?</summary>
A DC motor is the simplest kind of motor and has been used for decades due to their simplicity and low cost. There are two types of DC motorsâ€”the older brushed DC motors (BDC), and the newer and more efficient brushless DC motors (BLDC). First, let's understand how a BDC motor works. In the core of a BDC motor, there are permanent magnets. This is known as the stator, which remains in place. In the center, there is a commutator, which spins and has coils of wire. When current is induced into the coils, they create a magnetic field that interacts with the field of the stator. By reversing the polarity of the induced current into the coils at the right time, you can get the commutator to 'chase' the poles of the stator and thus spin. This current is controlled by the motor controller which we will discuss later. The reason the motor is brushed is that to deliver the current, metal brushes drag against the coils. This can inefficient, because over time the brushes wear down due to friction and general wear and tear, causing them to be less efficient. Thus a BDC is not as efficient as a BLDC at converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. Now let's examine how a BLDC solves the issues of a BDC. In a BLDC, the permanent magnet is now the commutator, and the coils are the stators. There are three coils. As current is induced in a coil, it will attract the magnet. At the same time, the coil behind it will energize in the opposite polarity, pushing the magnet away. As the magnet rotates, the coils are energized to carefully coordinate the rotation. To do so, a Hall Effect Sensor must be used, which is what makes BLDC motors more expensive and complicated. However, since the motor can use energy more efficiently, and does not suffer from the same energy losses that a BDC does, it is much more efficient and powerful.

<summary>The Part I Chose</summary>
When selecting an adequate motor, there were a few considerations I had to keep in mind. The first was the required voltage. I had already selected a 48V system, and thus could only choose motors that delivered peak power at 48V. Then, I had to select which company I wanted to purchase the motor from. After research, the company with a clear advantage was Motenergy. It delivered high quality and has a long history of creating innovative products. The next consideration was whether I wanted a brushed or brushless motor. In the end, cost was the deciding factor. While a BLDC would have been more powerful and efficient, the ocst was very high. Just for the motor it would have cost me somewhere around $1000, and I would still have to buy almost $1000 in supporting electronics. The cost of the kart would have been too much. Selecting this motor taught me an important lesson on the impact cost has on engineering. While there may have been a better option, I had to work within my budget, and therefore had to settle for a slightly worse part. Engineers face such constraints everyday, and I was glad I learned this lesson now. Now that I had slected a 48V BDC motor from Motenergy, I had to find the right model. Eventually, I settled on the ME-0909, which delivered 4.8 continuous kW at 100 amps, and 15kW for 30 seconds. The motor cost $550, and I was happy with the balance of power and cost.
